# Terms of Service for Commissioning with Me

I never thought I'd have to make a Terms of Service until I got scammed for the first time recently. 

Anyway, ***please read the following properly***.

## Payment Terms

- Robux Only.

- I accept payment through group funds, gamepasses, and clothing.

- IF YOU CHOOSE TO PAY THROUGH A GAMEPASS, YOU MUST COVER THE 30% TAX. (For some reason people tend to not see this one).

- I don't accept payments through percentage.

- You must show that you have the payment ready before we start the commission.

- You must provide the payment BEFORE I give you the scripts. After I've confirmed you've payed me, I will hand you the scripts/place file.

## Commission Terms

- I reserve the right to cancel the commission at any time for any reason without penalty. I'm not obliged to give you the reason for canceling either.
- When I cancel a commission, which doesn't happen often, the reason will always be serious. I will never cancel a commission for no reason.
- If you were to scam me in anyway, I will open source the project you commissioned me. I will also do several other things that you won't be happy with. Don't scam me, and everything will be fine. :)

If you have any questions about the Terms above, please let me know.

Once you have finished reading the Terms of Service, tell me these words exactly:

 "I fully understand your Terms of Service."
 
 That way I will know you have ready it. 
 
 Thanks for reading! :)
