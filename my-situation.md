# My Current Situation as a Programmer

Hello there. If you are reading this, you likely came because you saw my Discord status or saw me link this in one of my social media profiles.

Let me explain:

I've been pursuing my passion of programming for quite a few years now. It's something I truly care about and want to do for the rest of my life. However, I don't have a budget. I have zero dollars. Nor do I have any sort of payment method like a credit card or Pypal at all. _But until recently, this was never a problem._ I had all the tools I needed to program and develop what I love at the bare minimum, which is something I could've lived with until I could make money on my own.

My current and main IDE for all my projects is [Replit](https://replit.com), mainly because of how accessible it is. I can code at anytime, any where, as long as I have internet and have access to a browser of some sort.  ntil recently, I had used Replit for the hosting for my web apps. It wasn't great because the resources were limited unless you paid. But it wasn't really a problem for me because I could continue working on my web  applications and use them with pride even if the performance time wasn't that great. 

Replit was my only option for solid and easy hosting for my web application to fit my needs. I couldn't take advantage of free credits from other services like Digital Ocean and Google Cloud, so Replit was the next best thing.

This all changed when Replit made a recent change to make all web application hosting paid by January 1st, 2024. I relied on Replit to host my most prized project of all time: My private api. And now I couldn't host it. This was not only bad for my workflow, but also several of my other projects that used my API. Now I can't host any of my web applications at all. 

Now there is no where I can host my web application without paying or providing any sort of payment method. This really hurts because I'm no longer able to continue working on my projects. Sure, I could run them locally but that wasn't really ideal as that did not fix the issue with my websites breaking. I could also work on other projects that aren't web applications, but it's not something I can live with as I no longer have the tools to pursue my most prized projects, which were web applications.

This is why I am very demotivated and very depressed about the whole situation. A small price tag on the tools I used to continue programming was all it took to prevent me from being able to fully pursue my passion for programming.

I wrote this to explain my situation. I can't do what I love anymore.

I didn't write this to ask for donations to fix my situation. Nor did I write this expecting any sort of compensation. 

But what I am asking is for someone to help me find a way to continue hosting my projects the way I could before. 

I know it is very likely my situation will not get any attention at all, but this is the best I could do without looking like some sort of begger for money.

_But if you want to help or have a solution, please reach out to me on Discord (Username: ValiantWind)._

If you took you took your time to read this, thank you. Even if you can't help with my situation, I am thankful you took your time to understand my situation.

Thank you for your time. Have a nice day.
